      <h2>Highlights of League Opening Night — 24 January 2025</h2>

      <p>Storm Éowyn wasn’t enough to put off six brave poker players. Martin abandoned his wife in search of heat and light. Unfortunately, two squad players — Brendan and Steven — have morals!</p>

      <p>As usual, Morgan arrived just in time for the first break. Delighted to see Pocket 5s four times, he held up three — but his 99 and QQ fell to the sword every time, resulting in a rebuy. Hard to beat Kevin’s 7-2 off, as usual.</p>

      <p>The River Lee was in full flow, not a rebuy in sight — until he thought he could defeat the Director. As the night drew to a close, counting his €46, he raised three times with 88, only to meet resistance as Lynch reraised. Not to be deterred, Kevin jumped at the chance to steal the show with an all-in, only to get an instant call with KK, sending his night crashing down. So shocked was I, and under pressure from Kevin’s master plays, that I collapsed to the floor in shock — doing more damage than Éowyn.</p>

      <p>Bollywood bluffs were the star of the show, but not enough to stop Barry throwing in the orange chip before he could get a nut fart out. A poker of 6s kept him in the game until he sheepishly folded to an audacious K4 river Diver raise.</p>

      <p>Who raised six times the big blind with pocket 10s and got called by 8-5 offsuit? Our events manager. Unbelievable, Jeff!</p>

     

      <h2>Season Conclusion — 2025</h2>

      <p>
        The 2025 Letterkenny Poker Hunter League has officially come to a close, marking another year of dumb-ass plays, stupid rebuys, and unforgettable nights around the table.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a final night of Bollywood nut farts galore! Brendan attacked the table with his mighty full house, only for Captain Morgan to demolish his house like mica bricks with the poker of 2s.
      </p>

      <p>
        After months going all-in like at an all-inclusive buffet, <strong>Kevin Lee</strong> emerged as the 2025 League Champion. If only Arsenal follows his lead into May 2026.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>How could the Events Manager allow such multiple illegal rebuys!</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Thanks to the Event Manager and Champions League qualifier, Martin — ROI Champion!</em>

<section id="s2026-blog" class="content-section">
  <h2>2026 Season Blog — League Overview & New Format</h2>

  <p>
    The 2026 season kicks off on <strong>Friday, 2nd January 2026</strong>, bringing a refreshed league structure, stricter rules, and a brand‑new competitive format. This year also introduces the optional <strong>Champions League Final</strong>, giving players a high‑stakes finale to aim for.
  </p>

  <h3>Game Structure</h3>

  <p>
    The tournament is played over <strong>6 levels</strong>:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Levels 1–5: 30 minutes each</li>
    <li>Level 6: 45 minutes</li>
    <li>25‑minute break after Level 3</li>
    <li>15‑minute break after Level 5</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Buy‑in:</strong> €30  
    <br>Starting stack: 30,000 chips (15,000 + free 15,000 add‑on)
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Rebuy / Top-Up:</strong> €20 = 20,000 chips  
    <br>Max 1 per game, must be used before the end of Level 5.
  </p>

  <h3>End of Level 6</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Chips ÷ 1000 = cash‑out amount</li>
    <li>Chips × 50 = league points</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Champions League Format</h3>

  <p>
    The Champions League entry fee is €100 per player, spread across the year (typically €10 over 10 nights). We aim to play 12 league games, with each player’s <strong>best 10 performances</strong> counting towards their final league points.
  </p>

  <p>
    These points become your <strong>starting stack</strong> in the end‑of‑year Champions League Tournament, which is free to enter for all paid‑up players.
  </p>

  <p>
    Any player who cannot play the full 10 games may pay the balance due and will receive <strong>20 league points per €10</strong>, equivalent to 1,000 tournament chips.
  </p>

  <h3>Champions League Payout Structure</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Overall League Winner – 20%</li>
    <li>Tournament Winner – 25%</li>
    <li>Tournament 2nd Place – 15%</li>
    <li>Tournament 3rd Place – 12%</li>
    <li>Tournament 4th Place – 10%</li>
    <li>Tournament 5th Place – 8%</li>
    <li>Tournament 6th Place – 5%</li>
    <li>Tournament 7th Place – 5%</li>
    <li><strong>Note:</strong> Any player with less than 7,500 chips earned during the league will begin the final with a minimum stack of 7,500.</li>
  </ul>
