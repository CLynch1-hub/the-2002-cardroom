      <h2>Highlights of League Opening Night — 24 January 2025... A Storm was brewing</h2>

      <p>Storm Éowyn wasn’t enough to put off six brave poker players. Martin abandoned his wife in search of heat and light. Unfortunately, two squad players — Brendan and Steven — have morals!</p>

      <p>As usual, Morgan arrived just in time for the first break. Delighted to see Pocket 5s four times, he held up three — but his 99 and QQ fell to the sword every time, resulting in a rebuy. Hard to beat Kevin’s 7-2 off, as usual.</p>

      <p>The River Lee was in full flow, not a rebuy in sight — until he thought he could defeat the Director. As the night drew to a close, counting his €46, he raised three times with 88, only to meet resistance as Lynch reraised. Not to be deterred, Kevin jumped at the chance to steal the show with an all-in, only to get an instant call with KK, sending his night crashing down. So shocked was I, and under pressure from Kevin’s master plays, that I collapsed to the floor in shock — doing more damage than Éowyn.</p>

      <p>Bollywood bluffs were the star of the show, but not enough to stop Barry throwing in the orange chip before he could get a nut fart out. A poker of 6s kept him in the game until he sheepishly folded to an audacious K4 river Diver raise.</p>

      <p>Who raised six times the big blind with pocket 10s and got called by 8-5 offsuit? Our events manager. Unbelievable, Jeff!</p>

     

      <h2>Season Conclusion — 2025</h2>

      <p>
        The 2025  League has officially come to a close, marking another year of dumb-ass plays, stupid rebuys, and unforgettable nights around the table.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a final night of Bollywood nut farts galore! Brendan attacked the table with his mighty full house, only for Captain Morgan to demolish his house like mica bricks with the poker of 2s.
      </p>

      <p>
        After months going all-in like at an all-inclusive buffet, <strong>Kevin Lee</strong> emerged as the 2025 League Champion. If only Arsenal follows his lead into May 2026.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>How could the Events Manager allow such multiple illegal rebuys!</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Thanks to the Event Manager and Champions League qualifier, Martin — ROI Champion!</em>

  <h2>2026 Season Blog — League Overview & New Format</h2>

  <p>
    The 2026 season kicks off on <strong>Friday, 2nd January 2026</strong>, bringing a refreshed league structure, stricter rules, and a brand‑new competitive format. This year also introduces the optional <strong>Champions League Final</strong>, giving players a high‑stakes finale to aim for.
  </p>

  <!-- ========================= -->
  <!-- EVENT 1 - 2026 -->
  <!-- ========================= -->

  <h3>Highlights of League Opening Night — 2 January 2026... Winter is Coming...</h3>

  <p class="night-intro-2026">
    Attendance: 8 players — beer count: medium.
  </p>

  <p>Another cold start to January, with the snow falling, Brendan said No No to Carlow! and joined the warm crew.</p>

  <p>As usual, Morgan arrived just in time... Harumph... and went on a demolition Derby with great Pride Park, smashing the Director every time he popped his head up.</p>

  <p>The River Lee, not content with a League Title in 2025, is setting the standard again, showing Lynch that J7 is much better than AJ on the flop.</p>

  <p>Young Ryan, finally seeing a properly run game, was in excitement at the prospect of seeing his manager and mentor Barry "Bollywood" show off his legendary poker skills. They say you should never meet your hero, as his awe slowly dissipated like Barry's chips. But as Barry eloquently told him — "numb, mumb, blumb, mmm river"... following a mouthful of his favourite nuts.</p>

  <p>Young Mark made another guest appearance, but as he was continually outplayed by pops, he was glad to sit and watch the darts — and far enough away to hear Barry's farts.</p>

  <p>So the Event Manager, keen to impress his kin, watched his chips fade like his bunker in Berlin.</p>

  <h4>Man Of The Match... Solid performance, with a tinge of luck, the award goes to Kevin.</h4>

  <!-- ========================= -->
  <!-- EVENT 2 - 2026-->
  <!-- ========================= -->

  <h3>Highlight of Event 2 — 23 January 2026... The Night of the Sage...</h3>

  <p class="night-intro-2026">
    Attendance: 7 players — beer count: high.
  </p>

  <p>You just had to be there! Classic magic, monster hands as rare as a Morgan fold, and world‑class poker commentary.</p>

  <p>As usual, J7 tortured the Director — this time from the Derby brigade — smashing AQ on the flop with his J7 hitting two pair. With the usual chuckle and a Birra Moretti in hand, Morgan was dominating play until the break, but the chips soon faded like his new Blondie top.</p>

  <p>The River Lee will forget this one, certainly not making his top 10 hits. When Kevin and Morgan control the early show like Podge and Rodge, you know it's time to get out of Dodge.</p>

  <p>Young Ryan called in sick, still devastated by mentor Barry "Bollywood's" last showing — can you blame him?</p>

  <p>Mark had to defend against the bully Mr Black. Steven's courage was up after two Polish beers. Mark is still trying to explain that his full house beats trip Kings... who would have thought? Taxi for Mr Black please. Still, after the usual Morgan early thumping, Steven recovered to show all that he was the real King of the Hill and dazzled all with enough magic card tricks to brighten up Kevin's poor night.</p>

  <p>But the best card show of the night was handed out by Morgan, showing Barry his Q8 of hearts with the board showing 9, 10, J of hearts... Yep — a straight flush.</p>

  <h4>BUT WAIT — THERE'S MORE</h4>

  <p>Just when you thought things couldn't get any better, Morgan was treated to the most amazing sage advice. Up steps the Event Manager and explains to the winner that he could have bet on the river because — and I quote — "You were probably ahead of Barry on the river." Yes folks, a heads‑up showdown and there's a good chance a straight flush is ahead.</p>

  <p>This is poker commentary at its finest. Poker strategy books may need to be rewritten.</p>

  <h4>BUT WAIT — THERE'S MORE</h4>

  <p>With the Polish beer sinking in and a few before up "in the bin", it's time for Steven to push all‑in.</p>

  <p>It was a Barry raise and just in time for the Bollywood gaze... tick tock... Just when you thought poker knowledge had seen enough, Barry announced — "You have either a good hand or it's a bluff."</p>

  <h4>This new poker book writes itself</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Chapter 1 — A Full House beats trip Kings</li>
    <li>Chapter 2 — A Straight Flush on the river is possibly the best hand heads‑up</li>
    <li>Chapter 3 — An all‑in on the river is either a good hand or it isn't</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Congrats to Steven for a top recovery, and Morgan's straight flush moving him into pole position in the Champions League.</p>

  <h4>Man Of The Match... tough one between Steven for a marvelous comeback and Morgan's Straight Flush. But Steven edges it, especially for his Beer consumption</h4>
