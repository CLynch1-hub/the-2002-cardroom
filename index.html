        <h2>Highlights of League Opening Night — 24 January 2025</h2>

        <p>Storm Éowyn wasn’t enough to put off six brave poker players. Martin abandoned his wife in search of heat and light. Unfortunately, two squad players — Brendan and Steven — have morals!</p>

        <p>As usual, Morgan arrived just in time for the first break. Delighted to see Pocket 5s four times, he held up three — but his 99 and QQ fell to the sword every time, resulting in a rebuy. Hard to beat Kevin’s 7-2 off, as usual.</p>

        <p>The River Lee was in full flow, not a rebuy in sight — until he thought he could defeat the Director. As the night drew to a close, counting his €46, he raised three times with 88, only to meet resistance as Lynch reraised. Not to be deterred, Kevin jumped at the chance to steal the show with an all-in, only to get an instant call with KK, sending his night crashing down. So shocked was I, and under pressure from Kevin’s master plays, that I collapsed to the floor in shock — doing more damage than Éowyn.</p>

        <p>Bollywood bluffs were the star of the show, but not enough to stop Barry throwing in the orange chip before he could get a nut fart out. A poker of 6s kept him in the game until he sheepishly folded to an audacious K4 river Diver raise.</p>

        <p>Who raised six times the big blind with pocket 10s and got called by 8-5 offsuit? Our events manager. Unbelievable, Jeff!</p>

        <h2>Season Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          The 2025 Letterkenny Poker Hunter League has officially come to a close, marking another year of dumb-ass plays, stupid rebuys, and unforgettable nights around the table. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          With a final night of Bollywood nut farts galore!. Brendan attacked the table with his mighty full house, only for captain Morgan to demolish his house like mica bricks with the poker of 2s
        </p>

        <p>
          After months going all-in like at an all-inclusive buffet, <strong>Kevin Lee</strong> emerged as the 2025 League Champion. If only Arsenal follows his lead into May 2026.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>How could the events Manager allow such multiple illegal rebuys! </strong>
       </p>

        <p><em>Thanks to the Event Manager and champions league qualifier, Martin, ROI Champion!</em></p>
